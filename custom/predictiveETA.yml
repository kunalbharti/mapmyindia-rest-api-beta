    Unlock the power of location intelligence for complex routing problems. <br><br>We at MapmyIndia engineer rigorously tested routing algorithms for safe and efficient journeys that incorporate anticipated real time traffic updates for the most optimal and energy efficient routes. <br><br>This API computes the distance and duration of a route between a source/primary position (geographical coordinates) and a list of all supplied secondary positions. Optionally one can input the <code>dep_time</code> parameter and get the distance and duration optimized for that part of the day of a week. Time based functionality is available for selected cities only.<br><br> **Note**: <ol> <li> The response listed in the below documentation is ONLY indicative of the overall capabilities of MapmyIndia's Search APIs. </li><li> Not all response parameters mentioned in the below documentation is assured to be present in all the use-cases. The response of any of the below search API is thus, dependent on the use-case agreed upon between MapmyIndia & it's API consumer. </i><li> For any further clarifications on what all of the response structure is available for your use case, please contact your business relationship manager or contact MapmyIndia API support.</li><li> <strong>PREMIUM APIs</strong> are not available for evalulation on signup.

      description: >-
        This API computes the distance and duration of a route between a source/primary position (geographical coordinates) and a list of all supplied secondary positions. Optionally one can input the <code>dep_time</code> parameter and get the distance and duration optimized for that part of the day of a week. Time based functionality is available for selected cities only. Please note that maximum number of points are limited to 100 only including source and secondary positions.
